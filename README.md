# Semantic-Segmentation using AWS SageMaker

- Implemented semantic segmentation algorithm by classifying large, scalable Petâ€™s image data using AWS SageMaker 
- Deployed Fully-Convolutional Network algorithm with a backbone ResNet50 using Python to train a deep neural network
- Optimized the algorithm with RmsProp optimizer to provide high accuracy rate for image classification
